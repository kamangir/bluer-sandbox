> A modern survey of RSSI-based positioning techniques across BLE, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and 5G.
It explains theoretical limitations of RSSI (path-loss variability, multipath fading) and outlines correction strategies.

> A comprehensive review of how robot swarms estimate relative positions using sensors such as BLE, UWB, infrared, and vision. It categorizes algorithms by communication type, sensing range, and scalability.

- [From Robot Self‑Localization to Global‑Localization: An RSSI Based Approach” (ArXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10578) - 2021

> presents a **simulation-based** method for enabling groups of mobile robots to localize themselves in GPS-denied environments. Some robots act as fixed beacons, broadcasting signals whose received strength (RSSI) is used by other robots to estimate their global position **through geometric reconstruction**. The approach was tested only in simulation (Webots) and not on physical robots. Reported average errors were about 0.6 m with 10 % Gaussian noise, 1.4 m with 20 % noise, and ≈0.1 m in near-ideal short-range conditions (3–3.5 m from beacons); within about 6 m of beacons, the total error remained under 1 m.
